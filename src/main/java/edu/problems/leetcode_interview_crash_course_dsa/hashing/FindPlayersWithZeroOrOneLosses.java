/**
 You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri
 defeated player loseri in a match.

 Return a list answer of size 2 where:

 answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
 answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
 The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

 Note:

 You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
 The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
